# JavaScript-Challenge


WAKE UP EVERYONE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
   There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

    I've written a code that creates a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. I also allowed our users to filter the table data for specific values by using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web page given beforehand . They are the only coding languages I was allowed to use in order to implement the strength and the provide simplicity. 

   After all the planet Earth needs to know what we have found!
